            <h2>Hulker</h2>
            <h4>Atomic Defender</h4>
            <p>Hulker is a gentle giant with a wild side. The son of two SARAS (Search and Rescue Association of Solace) volunteers, he has always been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are common in the Outlands. However, he only began to understand the value of protecting others when he and his boyfriend stole his father’s motorcycle, took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide. His parents saved them, and his father lost an arm in the process. Hulker has never forgotten that sacrifice and has devoted his life to helping those in need.</p>
